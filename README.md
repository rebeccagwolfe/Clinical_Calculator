# Clinical_Calculator

The Clinical Calculator is an excel spreadsheet that I developed to help me and other quickly calculate tube feeding formula requirements and anthropometric data for our pediatric patients in a busy outpatient clinic. To use the calculator, follow the steps below.

Calculate what tube feeding provides and compare it to your patient’s needs
1. Navigate to the “Calculator for Liquid Formulas” tab
2. Start with the first green drop-down menu in the upper left corner to select the tube feeding formula. 
3. Next, under “Protein & Energy Needs”, select the age and gender of your patient in the green drop down menu below.
4. If adding a modular, click on the third green drop down menu a few rows below the formula menu. If no modular is needed, select “None”. 
5. Next, fill in the information in all yellow fields: input your patient’s weight, how many mLs of formula they receive over 24 hours,  and how many mLs of free water. If using a modular, select how many units/day.
6. After filling these fields, view the “Provides” statement to make sure the selected formula is meeting the proper percentage of energy, protein, and fluids 
7. This statement can be copied into your electronic medical record note to show exactly what the formula is providing

Catch Up Growth
1. If catch up growth is desired, input the ideal body weight in kg into the yellow field. 
2. Then copy the numbers in pink and input them into the red boxes.
3. In the estimated needs dropdown, select catch up growth at the bottom of the menu
4. This will change the energy and protein needs to reflect what is needed for the child to gain weight quicker in order to achieve catch up growth
5. 

Tube Feeding Regimen 
1. To figure out a desired regimen/schedule, select what percent of their formula will be provided by day time bolus feeds. 
2. Then select the number of bolus feeds and the number of hours their continuous feeds will infuse over.
3. If the patient needs to know the rate (how fast) to run the bolus feeds, input how many minutes the bolus feeds will infuse over, which will calculate the bolus rate
4. See Regimen statement below and copy into electronic medical record note
